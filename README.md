 Project Description

This project presents a Node.js Express application functioning as a contact database. Users can perform operations such as creating, viewing, editing, and deleting individual contacts. Notably, the application employs a file on the file system for data persistence, eschewing the use of a traditional database.

 Development Environment

- Operating System: MacOS
- Node.js Version: v20.11.1
- Code Editor: VS Code

5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

 Insights and Results

In the course of developing the Node.js Express application for the lab assignment, I established a robust foundation. The application serves as a contact database with functionalities such as creating, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts. Data persistence is achieved through a file on the file system. I provided a structured outline for the application, addressing key components such as route setup and data manipulation. Pug templates were created for various aspects, including the layout, home page, contacts list, single contact view, and new/edit contact forms. Despite encountering challenges, such as issues with raw JSON data retrieval, view engine configuration errors, and route conflicts, I successfully resolved these issues.
